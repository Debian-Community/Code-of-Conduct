<h1 align="center">Debian Community Code of Conduct</h1>
<h2 align="center">Last Edited: January 18, 2026</h2>

## Disclaimer:
By participating in Debian Community, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and any future updates to it. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. It will be the mission of the staff to communicate significant changes, and continued participation in the community after any updates posted will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms.
Additionally, you agree to comply with Discord’s Terms of Service & Revolt Community Guidelines where applicable. Violations of the above may result in suspension and/or permanent removal from both platforms within the Debian Community ecosystem.

## Community-Specific Rules
### 1. Age Requirements
Both Discord & Revolt state their minimum age requirement as being 13 years of age unless your country has specific requirements that have a higher minimum age. Meeting these age requirements does NOT grant you the ability to upload NSFW content within our instances.

---

### 2. Discrimination
We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive community for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or exclusion. All community members are expected to treat one another with respect and dignity, fostering an environment where all voices are heard and valued.

---

### 3. Respect Moderation

Moderators and administrators are here to ensure the rules are followed and that the community remains a safe space. They have the final say in all matters related to community guidelines. Please respect their decisions and do not engage in persistent arguments. If you have a concern about a moderator's conduct, you can report it to administrators privately using the `🎟-talk-with-staff` channel on Discord. The moderator in question will not be involved in the review of your report.

---

### 4. Expectation of Conduct & Discourse

Debian Community aims to be a server for high-quality discourse and support, and thus we will emphasize that you only contribute or participate in our discord with the expectation that low quality or low effort content is discouraged outside of our `memes` channel. For example, we are not going to demand that you only just post or start technical discussion, but posting something that does not make sense to post (for instance, posting animal noises, seeking to troll, incoherent spam, miscellaneous forms of brainrot, etc) is discouraged and moderation action make take place if a user continues to engage in it.

We do require that all communication in this community be in English; we don't have the resources available to moderate non-English conversation.

A user will be warned in tickets for first offense depending followed by a time-out at the input of the moderator or admin delivering a time-out. Expulsion from the server will be a last resort if behavior persists after the time-out.

---

### 5. No Unapproved Advertising

Advertising your own projects, communities, or services, or those of others, is not permitted without prior approval from the moderation team. This allows us to vet content and ensure it aligns with our community standards. Approved projects and communities will be listed in a designated channel, such as `friends-of-debian` on Discord OR `Related Communities` on Revolt.

---

### 6. Use Channels Appropriately

Please use the designated channels for their intended purposes. If you're unsure where a topic belongs, check the channel description or ask a moderator. Misusing channels can disrupt conversations and make it difficult for members to find the information they need.

---

### 7. Content Restrictions

To maintain a focus on technical discussion and a positive atmosphere, certain topics are restricted:

* 7.1 **NSFW (Not Safe For Work):** Any content that is sexually explicit, graphic, or otherwise inappropriate for a general audience is strictly banned.
* 7.2 **Political, Racial, or Religious Discussion:** These topics can be highly divisive. While some general discussion may occur, they should not dominate channels. Staff may ask you to move such discussions to direct messages if they become extensive or disruptive. Racial & religious discussion is strictly prohibited.
* 7.3 **Cross-Community Drama:** We are not the place to air grievances or discuss drama from other communities. Please keep discussions focused on our own community and shared interests.

---

### 8. Maintain a Positive Attitude

Repeated or excessive negativity is not tolerated. We encourage constructive feedback and healthy debate, but a persistent negative attitude can harm the community's welcoming nature. This rule is enforced at the discretion of the moderation team.

---

### 9. No DM Solicitation

Directly messaging other members without their consent, especially for the purpose of selling something, is strictly prohibited. If you join either server and immediately begin direct messaging other members to sell something, you will be banned without the possibility of appeal. Repeatedly messaging a member, especially a staff member or Debian Developers, after they have indicated they do not wish to be messaged will also result in an immediate ban.

---
### 10. Regarding Third-Party Clients

We prohibit discussion or promotion of any third-party clients for Discord as they are strictly against Discord Terms of Service. Any staff using third-party Discord clients will be dismissed regardless of rank. Revolt does not have any restrictions against usage of custom clients, but verify that the maintainers of the client are trustworthy enough for your personal benefit.

---
### 11. Regarding Usage of AI & AI Discussion

The general discussion of large language models or AI is permitted in Debian Community instances.
The usage of LLMs/AI to help users with support thread or questions is strictly prohibited. If you post a support thread or question, and your issue is being caused OR you have used AI at any point throughout the process of trying to resolve your issue, we will recommend for you to restart from scratch or do a complete system reinstall in severe cases. LLMs do not have human insight or understanding of the problem at hand; they merely are a construction of sentences that look like they make sense.

---
### General Rule of Thumb

Ultimately, these rules are guided by common sense. If something feels inappropriate, it probably is. The moderation team reserves the right to take action on any behavior that is disruptive or harmful to the community, even if it is not explicitly listed above. We are all here to learn and collaborate, so let's work together to make this a great place for everyone.
